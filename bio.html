<a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net/raman">Dr. T. V. Raman</a> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._V._Raman">accomplished Computer Scientist</a> with over 25
years of leadership experience in advanced technology
development. During this time, he has authored 3 books and filed over
75 patents; his work on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPTcNj-3kI8">eyes-free interaction</a> has been profiled in
mainstream publications including the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/business/04blind.html?_r=1">New York Times</a> and <a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/sciam-0996profile.html">Scientific American</a>.  
</p>

<p>
Dr. Raman now works on user-aware interfaces in the context of the
Google Assistant.  During his 12+ years as a Google Research
Scientist, he has worked on Google Search, Android and ChromeOS to
build the underpinnings of Accessibility on Google's core platforms.
</p>

<p>
He now works on the Assistant with the goal of creating friction-free
user interfaces for eyes-free interaction. His objective is to deliver
technologies that enable ubiquitous, eyes-free access to the cloud
from a wide variety of devices ranging from smart phones and tablets
to wearables. Speech is the next dimension in user interfaces, and
Dr. Raman develops application frameworks that combine speech
technologies with the power of the Cloud to deliver user-aware
interfaces that enable anytime, anywhere access to one's personal
smart assistant.
</p>

<p>
Raman did an MSc in Math and CS (1987&#x2013;1989) at the Indian Institute Of Technology
Bombay (IITB), before going on to do his PhD at Cornell University
(1989&#x2013;1994).  He came to Cornell as a mathematician who intended to
apply his mathematics background to the field of Robotics and Computer
Vision.  While doing his Computer Science coursework, he discovered
the potential presented by the combination of speech technology and
richly structured electronic documents, and started building a system
that used text-to-speech (TTS) to render such content &#x2014; this led to
<a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/phd-thesis/index.html">Audio System for Technical Readings</a> (AsTeR). Dr. Raman's PhD thesis
was awarded the <a href="http://awards.acm.org/award_winners/raman_4110221.cfm">ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award</a> in 1994.  This
dissertation defined several seminal concepts including that of <i>audio
formatting</i> and <i>structured browsing</i> &#x2014; concepts that have continued
to appear throughout his later work.
</p>


<p>
After finishing his graduate work at Cornell, Raman went on to apply
the concept of audio formatting and structured browsing to desktop
interfaces &#x2014; to further explore these ideas, he designed <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Speech/NOTE-ACSS">Aural CSS
(ACSS)</a> and built <a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net">Emacspeak</a> &#x2014; an Open Source project that he
continues to use for all his daily work. In addition to being an
effective research work-bench for eyes-free interaction, Emacspeak has
proven itself to be a useful Accessibility solution on a wide range of
platforms.
</p>


<p>
Previous to joining Google Research in 2005, Dr. Raman worked at
Digital Equipment Corporation, Adobe Systems and IBM Research. While
at Adobe, he brought the lessons learnt from  AsTeR  
to enrich PDF  with additional document structure to enable rich
information extraction. At IBM, he worked on multimodal interfaces to
the Web and   made seminal contributions to several W3C specifications
including <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/">XForms</a>.

<p>
On a personal note, my  favorite hobby is <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/publications/polyhedra">recreational mathematics</a>.  I enjoy working
on puzzles, especially those that involve an intuitive feel for
mathematics.  One of the things I enjoyed doing the most in the early
eighties was to solve the Rubik's cube faster than anyone else around
me, on an average of about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSSLj3KvkbI">thirty seconds</a>!  During the last few years,
discovering <a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net/raman/publications/polyhedra/">Zome Systems</a> for building complex polyhedra has helped
rekindle my interest in polyhedral geometry.  I am also interested in
linguistics and can speak about eight languages, including French,
German and several Indian languages.

<p>
Too many fond memories to fit in this margin, but highlights include
interacting with Prof. Isaac, having books read to me by an army of
freshmen volunteers, and walking to the CS Lab and writing code with
my able volunteers providing spoken feedback while looking over my
shoulder.
